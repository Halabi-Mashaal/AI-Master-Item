## 📈 **Next Steps & Monitoring:**

### **Recommended Monitoring:**
1. Track response times via `/chat` endpoint `response_time` field
2. Monitor cache hit ratios for optimization opportunities
3. Watch for slow queries (>2s) in application logs
4. Evaluate memory usage patterns for further optimization

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Redis Caching** - For distributed deployment scaling
2. **Async Processing** - Background heavy computations
3. **CDN Integration** - Static asset acceleration
4. **Database Optimization** - Query indexing and connection pooling
5. **Model Compression** - Smaller ML models for edge deployment

## ✅ **Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Test basic response time
curl -X POST http://your-app-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hi", "language": "en"}'

# Test cached response (run same command twice)
# First: ~0.2-0.5s, Second: ~0.008s

# Test file upload analysis  
curl -X POST http://your-app-url/chat \
  -F "message=analyze this file" \
  -F "file=@your-file.xlsx"
```
